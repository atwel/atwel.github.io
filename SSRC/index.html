					<aside class="notes">This project is a confluence of two interests of mine, social conventions--things like language, norms, even fashion--and our understanding of what signals from the nearly constant deluge of stimuli might actually be meaningful for social action. The latter is really what is motivating this research, but conventions are very present because of the experimental setup.<br>
					Ex. Language, driving on one side, opening doors for others, emoji meanings, internet slang, clothing styles, etc.

							What I'm going to show you is in fact an extension of the Name Game experiment, as reported on by Centola and Baronchelli in a 2015 PNAS article entitled the Spontaneous Emergence of Social Conventions.

							This experiment sought to understand what conditions would allow a group of participants to self-organize a social convention. In particular, they are interested in the role of network topology, the number of participants and the number of rounds the game is played for. Remarkably, neither the number of participants or the number of rounds made much of a difference in the outcome.

							Structure of game is simple. Experimenter wants to see if everyone in the group will starting to use the same name for a pictured individual with only local incentives for matching over the rounds.<br>
							In my slightly modified version, participants have 10 seconds to input a name for the pictured person (full-face, just not here). When inputing they can only see their earning and history. Here, there aren't any earnings or history yet.

							This result is strange, because we'd like believe large groups do create conventions without top down coordination, but very sensible because the clustering endemic to social networks creates within group competition.

						<aside class="notes">
							I'll remind you that the number of rounds (or participants) doesn't matter. This outcome seems to be endemic to the clustering of the network topologies. So what might types of mechanisms might allow successful self-organization? Maybe just a bit more information than just what interaction partners are doing could make a differences. The homogenous mixing case shows that coordination happens without knowing everything (broadcast), so just how much might be enough? Maybe just a bit more information about the niche, the environment these actors are creating, could make a difference. I'm using the word niche here in reference to the literature on niche construction in evolutionary theory. NC is the altering of a local environment in ways that benefits the occupants of that niche. This process can be a powerful aid to self-organization--I've argued elsewhere--because it is curiously self-referential. It embeds information about the structure it represents. For example, automobile safety is in part a function of the population of vehicle on the road...features like size determine the safety of the target vehicle and other vehicles...therefore a random sample of vehicles on the road can tell you something about the safety of any particular vehicle. Iteratively, this can construct ideas and actual outcomes, as when the American automobile market shifted to light trucks, like SUVs, pickups and other crossover vehicles. People came to believe larger is safer and made it so, a self-fulfilling prophesy driven by people's observation of the niche, among other things. So I'm interested in this process and how it relates to the outcomes of social processes of self-organization. I hypothesize that not alot of these niche signals can tip the system and I test that here.

							Look at this node over here playing "Jane". The distribution of names this participant has seen is a subset of that master distribution and it's very biased. Could just a little more, less biased information help? Like if the participant were able to overhear other people on the street?</aside>

							Here what I did: I just let them see another name, or two, from the distribution, choosen at random with replacement for each individual. Apriori it's not clear that this should help. In terms of obtaining knowledge about the true distribution, it's not much. But humans are good at extracting patterns and when we're doing this in a dynamic environment, it can make a big difference if it is feedback from the niche we're making.

							Now the way it did this is interesting. C and B argued that the full-connected network works because it had local failure, which was true, but not the fully story. More important was the quick eliminate of alternatives and seeing this other names did a lot to drive down the number of alternatives quickly. (ROW two is failures, ROW three successes).

							So this gives us some intuitions about why niche-signals made a difference. They drive down the number of names in circulation earlier on without causing groups to settle into competing conventions. But how is that done, or rather, why is that possible. Put more formally, how valuable are these additional signals from the perspective of information theory. To begin to access the value, I make use of the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. It's not a true measure because it's not symmetrical. It's also not necessarily going to be a great match for the phenomenology of humans processing stimuli, but it can tell us about the relative worth of some signals.
 						</aside>
						<h5>Kullback-Leibler divergence from $Q$ to $P$</h5>
						<p>$KL_t = \sum_{i=0}^N P_{i,t} * log \frac{Q_{i,t}}{P_{i,t}}$</p>

						<aside class="notes">This measures the informational value of niche-signal names

						<h4>Differences in Divergences (DD)</h4><br><br>
						<p>
							Let $ENS_{j,t}$ be the distribution of names seen with niche-signal names
							<br>
							Let $NNS_{j,t}$ be the distribiton of names seen <strong>without</strong> niche signal names</p>
						<br>
						<p>Then $DD_{j,t} = KL(ENS_{j,t}, \text{True}_t) - KL(NNS_{j,t},\text{True}_t)$</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<aside class="notes">This is the idea, but there is the problem that KL divergence needs the distributions to have the same support and the distribution of names seen by any given participant is lacking values in the true distribution. To correct for this, I take simply add a tiny weight to the missing values in the participants distributions and reweight the values actually seen in proportion to their original weighting. This creates a naturally conservative version of the KL measure.</aside>
