<h1> research summary</h1><br>

<h2>
	<p>I have long been interested in how economic and social value is socially constructed. While the embeddedness approach of economic sociology has yielded important insights into how economic action is not narrowly rational, it has yet to address how cognition itself is fundamentally a social process. The introduction of dual processes frameworks to cultural sociology has raised awareness about the social dimensions of cognition, but there is much work to be done.</p>

	<p>Given my background in dynamical systems research, I've come to focus on the sorts of information groups of actors rely on when they are collectively creating ideas around a new object or concept. The popularity and success of social network analysis has naturally lead others to focus on information from interactions with network alters, but our physical and digital environments are suffused with signals relevant for the cognitive processes that create our ideas about the world. My research explores the perhaps-essential role of signals from the broader social environment.</p>

	<p>I use a variety of methods to carry out this research agenda. It is very much motivated by insights I've gain through mathematical and agent-based modeling, but the natural limitations of those approaches have lead me to use behavioral experiments, more traditional statistical analyses, and newer data science techniques. I've found that each approach has informed the others and I am now a strong proponent of methodological eclecticism.</p>

	<p>The research map on my homepage provides an overview of my current projects and I will soon add more details here.</p>
