<h1> teaching </h1><br>
<h2><p>In fall 2013 I taught my own course at the University of Michigan called Social Dynamics.
This small seminar style class uses mathematical and computational models to explore the types of feedback that
make social dynamics an important area of research (that also happens to be a lot of fun). For the course, in collaboration with Elizabeth Bruch, I developed a toolkit to introduce students to big data collection and analysis. This package is being further developed and improved to share with other teachers with a generous grant from the University of Michigan's Third Century Initiative. The early version of the package can be accessed <a href="lab.html">here.</a></p>

<p>I also helped teach graduate students and faculty about how to use Python and related packages in their computational research during ARC's <a href="http://arc.research.umich.edu/2013/05/20/data-analysis-with-python-workshop-june-10-14/?utm_source=ARC+News+%2B+Events&utm_campaign=f2cd6a9118-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_24e6ff2a09-f2cd6a9118-44939565">Data Analysis with Python workshop</a></p>

<p>I have completed the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching's teaching certificate and have TA'd (GSI'd in Michigan lingo) for Sociology 102 (Children and Childhood) with Karin Martin, Sociology 102 
(Sports and Society) with Michael Ybarra, and Sociology 100 (Intro) with Robert Jansen.</p>
